Description: Provides implementations of computationally efficient maximum likelihood parameter estimation algorithms for models that represent linear dynamical systems. Currently, one such algorithm is implemented for the one-dimensional cumulative structural equation model with shock-error output measurement equation and assumptions of normality and independence. The corresponding scientific paper is yet to be published, therefore the relevant reference will be provided later.
