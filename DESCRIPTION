Description: Provides implementations of computationally efficient maximum likelihood estimation algorithms for system identification tasks. Currently, one such algorithm is implemented which identifies the one-dimensional cumulative structural equation model with normality assumptions. The corresponding scientific paper is yet to be published, therefore the relevant reference is not available yet.
