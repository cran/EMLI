# EMLI 0.2.0

- Added function calculate_likelihood that calculates the likelihood function.
- Changed the names of functions identify_model and evaluate_identification to estimate_parameters and evaluate_estimates, respectively, to better reflect their purpose.
- Changed requirements for model data: 1) it has to be the original model data, not its differenced version; 2) it has to be arranged in a data frame, not a list of two matrices.
- Added labeling for function outputs.
- Other small improvements.
